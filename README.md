# hello-microverse

> This is a site showing hello microverse text as a header. I setup hello-microverse repo and cloned into my local machine. Since the goal was to combine different tools for the best practices, I have implemented Linter, Github Flow rules,documentation of repo,adding a .gitignore file etc. here.
